\title{Automatically expands file paths based on project metadata.}
\usage{
auto_expand_paths(
  path_strings,
  meta = read_project_meta(),
  wildcard_name = extract_expand_wildcard()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_strings}{A character vector of file paths to process.}

\item{meta}{The pre-loaded metadata (from \code{read_project_meta()}).}

\item{wildcard_name}{The project's wildcard (from \code{extract_expand_wildcard()}).}
}
\value{
A character vector of processed paths.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of file paths and checks them against
the project's metadata. If a path contains a token found in the
metadata (e.g., "sample_1"), it replaces that token with the
project's wildcard (e.g., "{sample}"). If no token matches, the
path is returned unchanged.
